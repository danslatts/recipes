Chilli Jam

Ingredients

7– 10 Chillies chopped and seeded

1 kg of ripe tomatoes chopped

2 – 3cm piece of ginger finely chopped or grated

50ml fish sauce

200ml red wine vinegar

600g white sugar

4 – 5 cloves garlic finely chopped or grated

THERMOMIX Method

1. Place garlic, ginger and chillies (seeded or not) into Thermomix Bowl and Chop for 10 seconds/speed 8.

2. Place 1 kg of halved or quartered tomatoes (remove stalk centre) and chop for 40 seconds/speed 10.

3. Put all other ingredients in the Thermomix bowl and cook 60 minutes/100 degrees/speed 1 with Measuring Cap removed and the TM basket on the mixing bowl lid.

4. Remove TM basket from the mixing bowl lid (DO NOT replace Measuring Cap) and cook for another 75 minutes/100 degrees/speed 2 for jam, another 60 minutes/100 degrees/speed 2 for sauce.

FOR THE TM31 I just made it 19/11/2014 and used Varoma setting 70 minutes/Varoma/speed 2, and its done! :)

Amended 19/11/2104 FOR THE TM5 60 minutes/120 degrees/speed 2 for Sauce, then check consistency for Jam as it may only need another 10 minutes/120 degrees/speed 2. It depends on how thick you want it or no extra time depending on how watery your tomatoes are!

I know that this seems like a long time, but it needs it to develop the flavours and come together like a jam should (it will be worth it in the end)

5. Pour mixture into sterilised jars and seal immediately. If the jars seal correctly you can keep this in the cupboard for up to a year and opened in the fridge for up to 6 months (it never lasts that long in our house).
